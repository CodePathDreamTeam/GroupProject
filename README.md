Tripping is the must have travel companion. Complete with currency conversions, a weather station, photo journals of your travels with mapped out positions of your photos, points of interest near you. This app makes your travel experience and sharing much easier.

Problem â€“ 
When traveling you need to switch between multiple apps such as

Solution A one stop app for all your travel need.
